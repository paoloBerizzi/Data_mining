# Web Information Retrieval & Data Mining
Assignments part of the *Web InformationRetrival & Data mining* course at TU/E Eindhoven University of Technology during 2019/2020.

The course covered the principles and engineering aspects of machine learning, from data collection to designing robust and trustworthy machine learning systems.
 
 Topics tackled:
 
 * Machine Learning Algorithms (Architecture of learning algorithms, key learning techniques,  Kernelization, Ensemble Learning)
 * Machine Learning Pipelines (Model Selection, Feature Engineering)
 * Deep Learning (Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Network in practice)
 * Automated machine learning (Neural Architecture Search and pipeline synthesis, Hyperparameter optimization, Meta-learning techniques)
